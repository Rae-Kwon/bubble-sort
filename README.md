# bubble-sort

This is a simple bubble-sort program using enumerables. 

The function takes in an array and sorts the values in the array.

This project was done using instructions from The Odin Project's Ruby course.

# Usage

Clone this repo and run through the terminal with:

```
ruby ./bubblesort.rb
```

You can change the variable to sort and array of numbers using bubble sort. The output will be printed out in the terminal.
